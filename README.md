# Introduction
The main objective of this course is to teach algorithm design and analysis techniques. In this course,
students will learn how to investigate and analyze a problem and determine possible algorithmic
methods. Then, they analyze and compare candidate algorithm types with respect to their
computational complexities to decide the best one based on the characteristics of the input instance. In
this course, basic algorithms for common applied problems will also be presented.
